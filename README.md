A twitter bot that responds to mentions and DM's looking up vehicle citations.
==============================================================================

Post a tweet that mentions @HowsMyDrivingWA or a DM to @HowsMyDrivingWA (NYI)
and include a license plate of the form XX:nnnnnnn where XX is the 2 character
state and nnnnnnn is the license plate number (e.g. WA:ABC1234Q) and the bot
will reply with all the citations for that license plate in the King County
Court database.
