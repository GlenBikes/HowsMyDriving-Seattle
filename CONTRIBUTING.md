================

First off, thank you for considering contributing to @HowsMyDrivingWA. This was started as just a personal interest project after seeing @HowsMyDrivingNY and wanting to figure out if it was possible to do the same for Seattle.

I do this in my spare time, so the forward progress will possibly be irregular. I do have a couple of high level ideas of where I would like to take it but would love to hear ideas from others too.

What's the vision for @HowsMyDriving?
-------------------------------------

As soon as I figured out that it was possible for me to provide something roughly equivalent to @HowsMyDrivingNY, I also found out about @HowsMyDrivingDC and not exactly the same but similar @HowsMyDrivingAU.

I want to create an uber @HowsMyDriving that supports plug-ins to be able to do jurisdiction-specific handling of getting the info. Ideally then you could query a license and would get back results from all the registered jurisdiction plug-ins.

Let me know what you think!
